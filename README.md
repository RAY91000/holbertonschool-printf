# Printf Project

```
printf is a function used to print character strings that'll return to the terminal output.
This project's purpose is to recreate that very same function but under the name _printf.
```

## Flowchart



## The main purpose

We're looking to replicate the `character`, `string` and `integer`'s printing 
functionalities through this _printf function.
Here are some examples:

### Character

```
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("%c\n", 'K')
    return (0)
}
the output on the terminal will be K
```

### String

``` 
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello World", %s!\n")
